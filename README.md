Sudoku is a puzzle in which players insert the numbers one to nine into a grid consisting of nine squares subdivided into a further nine smaller squares in such a way that every number appears once in each horizontal line, vertical line, and square.


## How-to play


### New Game

Start a new game by selecting New Game from the Sudoku drop-down menu at the top. Difficulty can be selected in the difficulty submenu found in the Game menu. Each game only is guaranteed to have only one possible valid solution.

### Filling in a square

Fill in a square by clicking on it — it will be highlighted in blue and pressing the number that you want to put in the square. To erase a number, select on the square and press backspace. If you select a square with a number in it, the same number in other locations throughout the puzzle will be highlighted in light blue.

### Difficulty

There are three levels of difficulty — easy, medium and hard. Easy puzzles have 32 empty squares, medium 43 empty squares and hard puzzles have 54 empty squares.

### Hints and Error Checking

If you're stuck or want to check your progress for errors, there are options for both in the Game menu. Hints generally prefer, but are not guaranteed to fill in a square with a digit that already occurs most frequently on the board.

With checking turned on, incorrect squares have a background color of red when selected and a background color of blue with red text when selected.
